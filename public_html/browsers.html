    The introduction of the World Wide Web spawned a fiercely competitive battle among companies to own the
    front end of the Internet user experience. Their business strategies weren't clear, but they sparked the
    early days of the Internet gold rush.

        <h3>Mosaic</h3>
        <img src="images/mosaic.jpg" alt="jpg picture of Mosaic browser screen">
        <p>
            In 1993, Marc Andreesen and a team at the University of Illinois used Tim Berners-Lee’s World Wide Web open
            standards to create a Web browser to display html files on personal computers with an Internet connection.
            Their work led to the creation of NCSA Mosaic. (NCSA is the acronym for the University of Illinois' National
            Center for Supercomputing Applications.) The Mosaic browser was a user-friendly interface that displayed
            graphics in-line with text, rather than as a link to an image file. With simplified navigation, users could
            move between pages using blue underlined hyperlinks and bookmark the ones they liked. Installation and
            operation were relatively simple, and the cost was free. By mid-1994, Mosaic had nearly 50,000 downloads
            each month. It was then that Silicon Valley executive Jim Clark contacted Andreesen with a strategy to
            transform Mosaic into a new business venture.

        <h3>Netscape Navigator</h3>

        <p>
            Jim Clark was a Stanford Computer Science professor who had founded Silicon Graphics in 1982. Clark
            contacted Marc Andreesen about his Mosaic browser in 1994, and the two recruited other University of
            Illinois team members to found Netscape Communications Corporation to commercialize it. Netscape’s first
            commercial version had 2 million downloads before the company even officially announced it. The team added
            innovations like a mail reader, RSS feeds and dynamic JavaScript-powered Web pages, and made the browser
            available for Windows, Mac and Unix. In 1995, Netscape went public as a $3 billion dollar company. Suffering
            from brutal competition from Microsoft’s free browser, Netscape sold itself to AOL in 1999, which valued the
            brand more than the browser. In 2002, Netscape publicly released Navigator’s code as open source. This code
            would become the foundation to the Firefox web browser. By 2008, AOL had stopped supporting Netscape
            Navigator.

        <h3>Microsoft Internet Explorer</h3>
        <img src="images/explorer.jpg" alt="jpg picture of Internet Explorer logo">
        <p>
            Bill Gates at Microsoft was slow to see the potential of the Internet, but quickly played catch-up.
            Interested in creating a paywall gateway to the Web, Microsoft launched its first browser, Internet Explorer
            in 1995. At the time, Netscape had 80% browser market share, and Microsoft’s Explorer wasn't as good.
            Microsoft decided to make Explorer free as a Windows 95 bundled add-on. Microsoft pressured its vendors to
            include Explorer (but not Navigator) on all new PCs. Rapidly losing market share, Netscape sued Microsoft
            for anti-trust violations, but the Justice department did not take up the case until 1998. A Federal judge
            found Microsoft guilty of predatory and exclusionary business practices and recommended a break-up, but the
            Appeals Court rescinded the breakup order. While Microsoft had crushed Navigator, Explorer’s market share
            peaked in 2003 at 95%. Navigator’s open-source successor Firefox lured away users with an improved, more
            secure browser experience, and Google’s Chrome browser overtook Explorer in 2012.

        <h3>Firefox</h3>
        <img src="images/firefox.jpg" alt="jpg picture of Firefox logo">
        <p>
            The Firefox browser was released in 2004 as a free, open-source alternative to Microsoft’s Internet
            Explorer. It was developed by the Mozilla Foundation, which was originally established by Netscape in 1998.
            While users appreciated the independence from Microsoft, a monopoly company with profit motivations, Firefox
            was also highly praised for its innovation. It was not a full Internet suite as Netscape’s earlier versions
            had become, but functioned solely as a web browser. It was faster, more secure, and included add-ons like
            tabbed browsing. Firefox experienced 60 million downloads within nine months of its launch. Firefox’s market
            share peaked in 2009 at approximately 32%. Before long, its popularity was overtaken by Google’s Chrome
            browser. Today it has only an 8% market share of desktop users.

        <h3>Google Chrome</h3>
        <img src="images/chrome.jpg" alt="jpg picture of Chrome logo">
        <p>
            Google hired several developers of Mozilla Firefox and released its own Chrome browser in 2008. Google made
            it the default browser for its free Android operating system, and it became dominant on mobile devices,
            where Android is ubiquitous. Chrome features a minimalist user interface, including a combined address bar
            and search bar. Its private browsing feature prevents the browser from locally storing history or cookies.
            Today it is estimated that Chrome has a 68% worldwide market share.

        <h3>Apple Safari</h3>
        <img src="images/safari.jpg" alt="jpg picture of Safari window">
        <p>
            Apple introduced its Web browser with the rollout of its OS X Panther operating system in 2003. Prior to
            that, Apple licensed Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. While Safari was lauded as the fastest browser at the
            time, its usage was limited to Macintosh computers. Safari pioneered several features, but often lagged in
            adopting other web technologies. Rapid growth in the iPhone catapulted Safari’s mobile market share, and in
            2015, Safari became the #2 Web browser worldwide after Google Chrome. Apple now allows users to install
            third party web browsers on its devices, but Safari maintains a relatively stable 18% market share.
