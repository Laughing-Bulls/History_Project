                Jimmy Donal Wales worked at a futures trading firm, while coding in his spare time. He used his trading
                profits to launch an unsuccessful content/search engine, but then turned his attention to creating an online
                encyclopedia. In 2001, to supplement content creation for the initiative, he and partner Larry Sanger
                launched Wikipedia, an open-source, collaborative encyclopedia that allowed content contributions from
                ordinary people. The site’s popularity grew quickly, and today is one of the Internet's most popular sites,
                hosting over 57 million articles in over 300 languages. Wikipedia operates as a non-profit, and Wales
                remains on the board of trustees for the Wikimedia Foundation. He also co-founded the for-profit web hosting

                Fanning later launched a paid version of the site, which was acquired by Rhapsody in 2011.

                friend's garage attempting to catalog and search the new World Wide Web. They developed an algorithm that
                analyzed web page relevance, based on the links connecting pages to each other. “Google” initially launched
                on Stanford’s website (google.stanford.edu) in 1996, and became Google.com in 1997. Their algorithm was
                superior to existing ones, and Google quickly became the Internet’s most powerful search engine. Google now
