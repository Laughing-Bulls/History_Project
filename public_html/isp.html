<h3>
    America Online (AOL)
</h3>
<img src="images/aol.png" alt="png picture of a collection of AOL installation disks">
<p>
    America Online (AOL) - This private networking service first went online in November 1985 as PlayNET. The company went public in 1993, and edged out Prodigy and CompuServe to become the largest online service in 1995, with three million subscribers. New membership offers and CD-ROMs were ubiquitous, through direct mailings and partnership give-aways with products and event tickets. Early users of the dial-up service paid hourly connection fees, which later evolved into a flat monthly fee of $19.95.
</p>
<p>
    In 2001, with 30 million users, and near the peak of its market capitalization, AOL acquired media conglomerate Time Warner Corporation, which at $360 billion was the largest merger in history. After suffering rapid subscriber declines resulting from the growth of broadband and the World Wide Web, AOL was spun off from Time Warner in 2009. It was acquired by the phone company Verizon in 2015 for $4.4 billion, which subsequently sold it (and Yahoo!) to the private equity firm Apollo for $5 billion.

<h3>
    Compuserve
</h3>

<p>
    Compuserve - Founded in 1969, Compuserve was one of the first online services. Spun out of the Golden United Life Insurance company in 1975, it evolved from a business network to a fee-driven, dial-up consumer network. H&R Block acquired the company in 1980. The dial-up “walled garden” service offered email, online chats, online forums, software libraries and online games. Compuserve also introduced the .gif format for pictures. Its membership peaked in the early 1990s at around 3 million subscribers, and the subscriber service was acquired by rival AOL in 1997.

<h3>
    Prodigy
</h3>

<p>
    Prodigy - A joint venture between CBS, IBM, and Sears, Prodigy began service in 1984, as the use of personal computers began to explode. It offered a user-friendly selection of news, weather, sports, message boards and many other services. It was also a pioneer in online shopping and advertising. Bundled with sales of IBM’s PS1 and PS2 personal computers, by 1990, Prodigy had accumulated almost a million subscribers. The company was acquired by the newly-formed International Wireless in 1996 for $200 million, and went public in 1999. It was acquired in 2001 by SBC Communications, and later merged into Yahoo!.

<h3>
    GEnie
</h3>

<p>
    GEnie - The global conglomerate General Electric formed an online service in 1985 that utilized its GE mainframe computers during their down-time. GEnie (General Electric Network for Information Exchange) never received much investment by its parent, and was slow to increase capacity and integrate new features. In 1996, GE sold GEnie to Yovelle, which was later acquired by IDT Corporation. Peaking at only a few hundred thousand users, IDT shut down GEnie at the end of 1999.

<h3>
    MSN (the Microsoft Network)
</h3>

<p>
    MSN - Microsoft was late to offer its own service, MSN (the Microsoft Network) in 1995, alongside its Windows 95 release. It was initially a dial-up service, which branched into a range of products and services for Windows devices. In 1998, the subscription model was retooled, and MSN transformed into a free web portal that serves as a collection of Internet services and Microsoft apps.
