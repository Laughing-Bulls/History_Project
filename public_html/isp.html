                America Online (AOL) - This private networking service first went online in November 1985 as PlayNET. The
                company
                went public in 1993, and edged out Prodigy and CompuServe to become the largest online service in 1995, with
                three
                million subscribers. New membership offers and CD-ROMs were ubiquitous, through direct mailings and
                partnership
                give-aways with products and event tickets. Early users of the dial-up service paid hourly connection fees,
                which
                later evolved into a flat monthly fee of $19.95.
                In 2001, with 30 million users, and near the peak of its market capitalization, AOL acquired media
                conglomerate
                Time
                Warner Corporation, which at $360 billion was the largest merger in history. After suffering rapid
                subscriber
                declines resulting from the growth of broadband and the World Wide Web, AOL was spun off from Time Warner in
                2009.
                It was acquired by the phone company Verizon in 2015 for $4.4 billion, which subsequently sold it (and
                Yahoo!)
                to
                the private equity firm Apollo for $5 billion.

                Compuserve - Founded in 1969, Compuserve was one of the first online services. Spun out of the Golden United
                Life
                Insurance company in 1975, it evolved from a business network to a fee-driven, dial-up consumer network. H&R
                Block
                acquired the company in 1980. The dial-up “walled garden” service offered email, online chats, online
                forums,
                software libraries and online games. Compuserve also introduced the .gif format for pictures. Its membership
                peaked
                in the early 1990s at around 3 million subscribers, and the subscriber service was acquired by rival AOL in
                1997.

            <p>
                Prodigy - A joint venture between CBS, IBM, and Sears, Prodigy began service in 1984, as the use of personal
                computers began to explode. It offered a user-friendly selection of news, weather, sports, message boards
                and
                many
                other services. It was also a pioneer in online shopping and advertising. Bundled with sales of IBM’s PS1
                and
                PS2
                personal computers, by 1990, Prodigy had accumulated almost a million subscribers. The company was acquired
                by
                the
                newly-formed International Wireless in 1996 for $200 million, and went public in 1999. It was acquired in
                2001
                by
                SBC Communications, and later merged into Yahoo!.

                GEnie - The global conglomerate General Electric formed an online service in 1985 that utilized its GE
                mainframe
                computers during their down-time. GEnie (General Electric Network for Information Exchange) never received
                much
                investment by its parent, and was slow to increase capacity and integrate new features. In 1996, GE sold
                GEnie
                to
                Yovelle, which was later acquired by IDT Corporation. Peaking at only a few hundred thousand users, IDT shut
                down
                GEnie at the end of 1999.

                MSN - Microsoft was late to offer its own service, MSN (the Microsoft Network) in 1995, alongside its
                Windows 95
                release. It was initially a dial-up service, which branched into a range of products and services for
                Windows
                devices. In 1998, the subscription model was retooled, and MSN transformed into a free web portal that
                serves as
                a
                collection of Internet services and Microsoft apps.
