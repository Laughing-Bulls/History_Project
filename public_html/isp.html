            America Online (AOL)
        </h3>
        <img src="images/aol.png" alt="png picture of a collection of AOL installation disks">
        <p>
            America Online (AOL) - This private networking service first went online in November 1985 as PlayNET. The
            company
            went public in 1993, and edged out Prodigy and CompuServe to become the largest online service in 1995, with
            three
            million subscribers. New membership offers and CD-ROMs were ubiquitous, through direct mailings and
            partnership
            give-aways with products and event tickets. Early users of the dial-up service paid hourly connection fees,
            which
            later evolved into a flat monthly fee of $19.95.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2001, with 30 million users, and near the peak of its market capitalization, AOL acquired media
            conglomerate
            Time
            Warner Corporation, which at $360 billion was the largest merger in history. After suffering rapid
            subscriber
            declines resulting from the growth of broadband and the World Wide Web, AOL was spun off from Time Warner in
            2009.
            It was acquired by the phone company Verizon in 2015 for $4.4 billion, which subsequently sold it (and
            Yahoo!)
            to
            the private equity firm Apollo for $5 billion.

            Compuserve
        </h3>
        <img src="images/compuserve.png" alt="png picture of the Compuserve member screen">
        <p>
            Compuserve - Founded in 1969, Compuserve was one of the first online services. Spun out of the Golden United
            Life
            Insurance company in 1975, it evolved from a business network to a fee-driven, dial-up consumer network. H&R
            Block
            acquired the company in 1980. The dial-up “walled garden” service offered email, online chats, online
            forums,
            software libraries and online games. Compuserve also introduced the .gif format for pictures. Its membership
            peaked
            in the early 1990s at around 3 million subscribers, and the subscriber service was acquired by rival AOL in
            1997.

            Prodigy
        </h3>
        <img src="images/prodigy.png" alt="png picture of the Prodigy login on a computer screen">
        <p>
            Prodigy - A joint venture between CBS, IBM, and Sears, Prodigy began service in 1984, as the use of personal
            computers began to explode. It offered a user-friendly selection of news, weather, sports, message boards
            and
            many
            other services. It was also a pioneer in online shopping and advertising. Bundled with sales of IBM’s PS1
            and
            PS2
            personal computers, by 1990, Prodigy had accumulated almost a million subscribers. The company was acquired
            by
            the
            newly-formed International Wireless in 1996 for $200 million, and went public in 1999. It was acquired in
            2001
            by
            SBC Communications, and later merged into Yahoo!.

        <img src="images/genie.png" alt="png picture of the GEnie welcome screen">
        <p>
            GEnie - The global conglomerate General Electric formed an online service in 1985 that utilized its GE
            mainframe
            computers during their down-time. GEnie (General Electric Network for Information Exchange) never received
            much
            investment by its parent, and was slow to increase capacity and integrate new features. In 1996, GE sold
            GEnie
            to
            Yovelle, which was later acquired by IDT Corporation. Peaking at only a few hundred thousand users, IDT shut
            down
            GEnie at the end of 1999.

            MSN - Microsoft was late to offer its own service, MSN (the Microsoft Network) in 1995, alongside its
            Windows 95
            release. It was initially a dial-up service, which branched into a range of products and services for
            Windows
            devices. In 1998, the subscription model was retooled, and MSN transformed into a free web portal that
            serves as
            a
            collection of Internet services and Microsoft apps.
