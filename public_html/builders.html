            In a quest to design a communications system that would survive an enemy attack better than the centralized telephone network, Paul A. Baran theorized a “distributed packet-switched” network. In 1964, as a RAND Corporation researcher, Baran published papers describing a detailed architecture for the distributed digital communications network that later became the modern Internet.

            A physicist and computer scientist, Timothy John Berners-Lee worked at CERN, , the European Organization for Nuclear Research. In 1989, he invented the World Wide Web, a project using hypertext to facilitate information sharing on a network. Berners-Lee is the director of W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium, a standards setting organization for the Web's continued development.

            Along with Bob Kahn, Vinton G. Cerf is considered one of the “fathers of the Internet”. The two partners came up with the TCP/IP protocol in 1974, working on Leonard Kleinrock's networking group connecting the first two nodes of ARPAnet. Cerf also helped form the Internet Society and ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).

            In 1974, Robert E. Kahn invented the TCP/IP protocols along with his partner Vint Cerf. Both helped develop ARPAnet, and extended that knowledge to LANs, WANs and other connected networks. In 1983, TCP/IP was adopted as the common communication protocol for the Internet.

            In 1961, Leonard Kleinrock introduced queuing theory for data packets. Demand access and distributed control. Working at UCLA, he oversaw a team that connected the first node to ARPAnet in 1969. His work on packet-switched networks became central to how the Internet operates.

            Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider was a psychologist and professor at MIT in the 1950s. In 1962, he developed the idea of a global digital network in a series of papers describing the “Intergalactic Computer Network.” He worked at ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), and provided inspiration and guidance for ARPAnet.

            Robert Melancton Metcalfe is considered the inventor of Ethernet and was a founder of 3Com. He worked on ARPAnet at MIT and later served as a researcher at Xerow PARC (Palo Alto Research Center). His 1972 pamphlet, Scenarios for the ARPAnet, imagined a variety of new network applications, including games, mathematics, and remote jobs. Metcalfe's law postulated that the value of a network grows as the square of the number of its users.

            Lawrence G. Roberts was a program manager at ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), where he worked on Paul Baran’s idea for ARPAnet, the first distributed packet switched network. He later became CEO of Telenet, the first data network utility.

            Robert W. Taylor was a director of Information Processing at ARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency. In 1969, Taylor convinced the agency to construct a distributed computer network. ARPAnet, as it was known, was the grandfather of the Internet. Taylor later founded the Computer Science Laboratory of Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center).

            Raymond Samuel Tomlinson was the computer programmer who invented email. His employer, Bolt, Beranek and Newman, worked on projects for ARPAnet, the predecessor of the Internet. In 1971, he sent the first email, including an “@” symbol to designate an address, to another computer across the room.
