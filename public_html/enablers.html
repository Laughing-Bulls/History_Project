                Raymond Samuel Tomlinson was the computer programmer who invented email. His employer, Bolt, Beranek and
                Newman, worked on projects for ARPAnet, the predecessor of the Internet. In 1971, he sent the first email,
                including an “@” symbol to designate an address, to another computer across the room.

                William Henry Gates III was a co-founder with Paul Allen of the software company Microsoft. In 1975, he
                dropped out of Harvard to run the company that put the operating system DOS on every IBM personal computer.
                Following Apple’s lead, they later developed “Windows”, a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for the operating
                system. Microsoft continued to thrive with its Office suite, Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers, and
                Xbox video games.

                Paul Gardner Allen was a computer scientist who partnered with his childhood friend Bill Gates to create
                Microsoft. Together, they helped to usher in the personal computer revolution. His initial project was to
                write the BASIC programming language to be used on Altair’s microcomputer. In 1980, they licensed to IBM the
                MS-DOS operating system, which quickly became the dominant one for personal computers. He left the company
                in 1983, becoming active in philanthropy and technology investing.

                Steven Paul Jobs co-founded Apple Inc. in 1976. With co-founder Steve Wozniak, Jobs created one of the first
                commercially successful personal computers. In the early 1980s, Jobs introduced a mouse-driven GUI
                (Graphical User Interface) on the Macintosh personal computer, and Apple stayed in the forefront of hardware
                and software development. He was forced to leave Apple in 1985, but returned as CEO in 1997, when Apple
                bought his company NeXT. Apple went on to pioneer the iPhone in 2007, sparking the rise of the mobile
                Internet.

                World Wide Web open standards to create a graphical Web browser that could display html files on personal
                computers with an Internet connection. In 1993, he joined Jim Clark to found Netscape Communications. He
